            <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>My educational journey has been one of perseverance, growth, and passion for learning. It all began at Little Flower Senior Secondary School, where the seeds of curiosity and knowledge were sown within me. The nurturing environment of my school not only equipped me with academic prowess but also instilled in me values of discipline and dedication.<br></br>

                Throughout my schooling years, I found myself drawn towards the realm of technology and computers. It was during this time that I realized my inclination towards Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). With unwavering determination and a clear vision of my goals, I embarked on the path to pursue higher education in this field.<br></br>
                
                Currently, I am enrolled at Gauhati University of Science and Technology, pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Computer Science and Engineering. This phase of my education has been nothing short of transformative. The rigorous curriculum and hands-on learning experiences have broadened my understanding of computer systems, programming languages, and various technological concepts.</p>
